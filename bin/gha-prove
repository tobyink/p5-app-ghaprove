  $ gha-prove -b -r -v 't'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<< gha-prove >> is just a small wrapper around the C<< prove >> command.
It will inspect C<< GHA_* >>> environment variables and this will affect
how it calls C<< prove >>, perhaps calling C<< prove >> multiple times.
It is intended to be used in continuous integration environments, such as
GitHub Actions.
